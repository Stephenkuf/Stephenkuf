### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!


I'm Kuforiji Stephen, a full-stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from Nigeria. my passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces and API's. I take great care in the design,  architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

A software engineer with over five (5) years of work experience developing APIs and microservices using NodeJS(Nest js, Express, Adonis). I have a solid understanding of design patterns, data structures & algorithms. Late-night coding and gaming are vices of mine.
